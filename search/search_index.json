Essentially, a dev container is a predefined setup, typically powered by Docker, that creates isolated and reliable environments for development. Think of it as a self-contained \"mini computer\" within your system, preloaded with everything required for a specific project.</p> <p>Why is this important? In the tech industry, projects often rely on a precise set of tools and dependencies to function correctly. Without a dev container, developers must configure their environments manually, which can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and wasted time. A dev container ensures that everyone on the team works in an identical environment. It also streamlines the onboarding process for new team members, allowing them to get started quickly with minimal setup.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#step-1-add-development-container-configuration","title":"Step 1: Add Development Container Configuration","text":"<ol> <li>Open the <code>go-dev-container</code> directory in VS Code.

When you search for VSCode extensions on the marketplace, you will find the string identifier of each extension in its sidebar. Adding extensions here ensures other developers on your project have them installed in their dev containers automatically.</li> <li><code>postCreateCommand</code>: This specifies a command to execute after the development container is created.
